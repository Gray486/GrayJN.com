		<h1>Probability Simulator</h1>
		<p class="project-desc">
			A peronal project multiplayer probability-skill game developed in Typescript with Node.JS. This project 
			uses SQL with the Sequalize ORM and custom classes to store userdata. Users can friend each other, send invite 
			notifications using service workers, and send direct messages. It features authenticated Google 
			login using the OAuth 2.0 Google sign in API and JSON Web Tokens to verify users. All of this is integrated into a simple user-friendly webpage.
			Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Gray486/Probability-Simulator" target="_blank">source code</a>, or view it

		<h1>Offseason Robot Code 2024</h1>
		<p class="project-desc">
			The programming team decided to rewrite our code for the 2024 robot, implementing new subsystem structures with
			IO interfaces and simualtion, a state based control system, and overall better, more thought-out code.
			We also implimented Vision that allowed our robot to align with QR codes (Apriltags) around the field
			for more accurate and longer ranged shooting. This project was written in Java using
			<a target="_blank" href="https://wpilib.org/">WPILib</a> to interact with motors and the
			RoboRIO, a controller that manages the robot's sensors and actuators.

			The project for our teams 2024 season Robot. This was my rookie FRC year, however I was able quickly 
			learn Java and WPILib, and became the lead of the Programming subteam. This project contained a command based
			project structure with subsystems that controlled motors and read sensor values, which allowed our
			robot to climb and hang on a chain, intake and rapidly shoot foam disks, and drive using swerve. View the
